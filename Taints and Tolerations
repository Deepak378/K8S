taints & tolerations:---
-------------
taints ----- node condition
toleration ------ pod condition
if taints=toleration ------> then only pod will be created in the scheduled node

taints---- 
key=value:effect
ex:---
fruit=apple:NoSchedule
fruit=apple:NoExecute
effects:---
NoSchedule------    All existing pods will continue their operations
NoExecute---------  All existing pods will terminate & if any pods are under replica/deployments/ statefulset --- they will be recreated in other worker node

lab:--
taints:---
# kubectl describe nodes worker1 |less
#kubectl taints node worker1 freuit=apple:NoSchedule
# kubectl describe nodes worker1 |grep -i taints
# kubectl taint node worker1 fruit-             ------->> to remove taints value


Create pod with toleration value:---
apiVersion: v1         
kind: Pod              
metadata:              
 name: toleration-pod           
spec:                  
 containers:           
 - name: xyz           
   image: nginx
   imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
 tolerations:          
 - key: "fruit"        
   operator: "Equal"   
   value: "apple"      
   effect: "NoExecute"
